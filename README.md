# Project Name

This project showcases a dynamic web page featuring an interactive flower garden. It utilizes HTML, SCSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, demonstrating a modern web development workflow.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Required for various development tools. Download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Our recommended IDE, available at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Recommended VS Code Extensions

Enhance your development experience with these extensions:
